### RAG application using LangChain

This project has a [Supporting article]() in my blog.

This project uses all open source and freely available resources to create a simple LangChain application.

The overview of the project is below,

The idea is to create a RAG app that takes a blog post as the relevant info and pass that as context to the LLM and get a grounded response.

It uses LangSmith to see the traces as well, which is very useful for seeing what actually happens under the hood.
